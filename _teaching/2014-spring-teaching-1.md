The course begins with an introduction to the design of different types of sample surveys and analysis of data from different sampling designs, e.g. weighting procedures and use of auxiliary information. An important element during the course is how to handle drop-out, e.g. by preventing dropouts, follow-up investigations in the dropout group and imputation of missing values. During the course, the statistical software R. is used.
