I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the French national research institute [Inria](https://inria.fr/en) in Sophia Antipolis, France. I’m part of the [Maasai](https://team.inria.fr/maasai/) (Models and Algorithms for Artificial Intelligence) team. I’m also affiliated with the [J.A. Dieudonné lab](https://math.unice.fr/laboratoire/pr%C3%A9sentation-du-laboratoire.html), which is the mathematics department of Université Côte d’Azur.

I received my PhD in 2020 from Umeå University, where I worked on psychometric modeling for large-scale assessments under the supervision of Professor Marie Wiberg.

My field of research is model-based clustering and co-clustering, and psychometrics.
