I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the French national research institute [Inria](https://inria.fr/en) in Sophia Antipolis, France. I’m part of the [Maasai](https://team.inria.fr/maasai/) (Models and Algorithms for Artificial Intelligence) team. I’m also affiliated with the [J.A. Dieudonné lab](https://math.unice.fr/laboratoire/pr%C3%A9sentation-du-laboratoire.html), which is the mathematics department of Université Côte d’Azur.

My field of research is twofolded: 1) Model-based co-clustering, and 2) Psychometrics. The first theme of my research involves model-based approaches for simultaneous clustering of the rows and columns of the data matrix, together with stochastic EM algorithms that are developed for these models. For the second theme, my research includes differential item functioning, test score equating, and Bayesian latent variable modeling. 

I received my PhD in 2020 from Umeå University, where I worked on psychometric modeling for large-scale assessments under the supervision of Professor Marie Wiberg.
