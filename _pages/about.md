I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the French national research institute [Inria](https://inria.fr/en) in Sophia Antipolis, France. I’m part of the [Maasai](https://team.inria.fr/maasai/) (Models and Algorithms for Artificial Intelligence) team. I’m also affiliated with the [J.A. Dieudonné lab](https://math.unice.fr/laboratoire/pr%C3%A9sentation-du-laboratoire.html), which is the mathematics department of Université Côte d’Azur.

My field of research is two-folded: 1) Model-based clustering and co-clustering, and 2) Psychometrics. For the first theme, my research involves latent block models for clustering of high-dimensional data, stochastic EM algorithms and Markov chain Monte Carlo. For the second theme, my research include differential item functioning, test score equating, and Bayesian latent variable modeling. 

I received my PhD in 2020 from Umeå University, where I worked on psychometric modeling for large-scale assessments under the supervision of Professor Marie Wiberg.
